						I am career shifting from health and fitness to become a web developer that is interested in creating fitness and health management and marketing software applications to allow users to self-regulate their lifestyle nutrition and exercise requirements.  I would then like to progress that knowledge  in order to impliment these technologies accross different platforms for mobile applications. I would like to help people optimize their health via automated guidance. Along the way, I look forward to learning, growing, and contributing to other projects with a team.
